<h1>A guide to Boxpulse</h1>

<p class="first"><em>Boxpulse</em> offers a certain elegance and includes a template made specifically for the included slider.</p>

<p class="second">The slider offered by <em>Boxpulse</em> makes it easy to setup an attractive homepage that features posts with text and images.</p>

<h2>How to install Boxpulse</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Install the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/hybrid" title="Hybrid WordPress theme">Hybrid theme</a> first. This is required to run the <em>Boxpulse</em> child theme.</li>
	<li>Unzip the <code>boxpulse.zip</code> file (you've probably already done this).</li>
	<li>Upload the <code>boxpulse</code> folder to your <code>/wp-content/themes</code> directory.</li>
	<li>Go to <em>Appearance > Themes</em> in your WordPress admin.</li>
	<li>Activate the <em>Boxpulse</em> theme.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Using the slider template</h2>

<p>The theme is a child theme for the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/hybrid" title="Hybrid WordPress theme">Hybrid theme framework</a>, which means you must have <em>Hybrid</em> installed to use <em>Boxpulse</em>.  Don't worry.  Just because it uses a framework doesn't mean it's complicated.  It just means that your site will be a lot more powerful and all you have to do is have <em>Hybrid</em> installed. Everything should work from the moment you have everything installed.</p>

<h3>Theme Settings</h3>

<p><em>Boxpulse</em> allows you to use the included template, Slider. This template turns your page into a full-width slider that scrolls through recent posts.</p>

<p>The slider will show the excerpt of a post and an associated image (using the "<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/get-the-image/">Get the Image</a>" plugin which is already included in the theme) if one exists.</p>

<p>To change any settings pertaining to the images in the slider, see the ReadMe file included with the "Get the Image" plugin.</p>
